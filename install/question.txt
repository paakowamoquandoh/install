You are developing an IDE libraries installer.

On the preview page you can see the following elements:

The left rectangle box containing the list of libraries available for installation;
The right rectangle box containing the list of libraries which were selected to be installed;
Two arrow buttons for moving libraries between two boxes described above;
An Install button simulating the installation of the libraries by clearing the right box.

Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Selecting library
  Given Either left box or right box is not empty 
   When Any library from any of these boxes is clicked upon

    And "libs-installer__item--selected" CSS class is removed from other libraries in both boxes
Scenario: Moving library between boxes
  Given One of the libraries is selected 
   When The arrow button pointing towards the opposite box is clicked
   Then The library is moved to the opposite box
    And Libraries in both boxes are sorted by their id's in ascending order
    And None of the libraries are marked as selected
Scenario: Moving library in the wrong direction
  Given One of the libraries is selected 
   When The arrow button pointing away from the opposite box is clicked
   Then Both boxes stay as is
    And None of the libraries are marked as selected
Scenario: Clicking "Install" button
  Given The right box is not empty 
   When The "Install" button is clicked
   Then Right box becomes empty

Notes
The template already contains the code that renders the installer. Your task is to provide the implementations for the selectLibrary, onMoveLeftClick, onMoveRightClick and installLibraries button click handler functions.
You can expand the test results to see a more detailed report.
Please use the provided template, as the tests access the elements by using the CSS selectors. If you change the structure of the DOM elements, the tests will fail.
